# Reinforcement_Learning_Resources

Learning Roadmap for LLM Training + GRPO
Month 1 → Foundations (Transformers + Deep Learning)

🎯 Goal: Be fully comfortable with transformers, optimization, and training pipelines.

Courses & Books

Deep Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng, Coursera)
 → for solid ML/DL grounding.

Dive into Deep Learning (d2l.ai, free)
 → hands-on PyTorch coding.

The Illustrated Transformer
 → intuitive understanding of attention.

Practice

Train a small transformer (e.g., character-level GPT) using PyTorch.

Implement attention from scratch (lots of great notebooks exist).

Month 2 → Reinforcement Learning Basics (for PPO/GRPO)

🎯 Goal: Understand RL concepts deeply enough to follow PPO.

Courses

David Silver’s RL Lectures (DeepMind, YouTube)
 → conceptual backbone.

Spinning Up in Deep RL (OpenAI)
 → hands-on PPO implementation.

Practice

Implement PPO on a toy problem (CartPole in Gymnasium).

Understand policy gradient, value function, advantage estimation (needed for PPO → GRPO).

Month 3 → RLHF for LLMs (PPO → GRPO)

🎯 Goal: Transition from generic RL → RLHF for LLMs.

Core Papers

OpenAI (2017): Fine-Tuning LMs from Human Preferences

Anthropic (2022): Constitutional AI

DeepSeek (2024): GRPO Algorithm

Tutorials & Tools

HuggingFace TRL (Transformers + RLHF)
 → PPO training with LLMs.

Unsloth
 → GRPO implementation with fast/quantized training.

Explore DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) as a lighter alternative to PPO.

Practice

Run PPO fine-tuning on a small model (like LLaMA-7B or Mistral-7B with HuggingFace TRL).

Switch to GRPO with Unsloth and compare PPO vs GRPO training.

Month 4 → Efficiency (Quantization + MoE + Scaling Tricks)

🎯 Goal: Learn how big labs make LLMs fast & efficient.

Quantization

Papers: LLM.int8(), SmoothQuant.

Try 4-bit & 8-bit quantization with Unsloth/QLoRA.

Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Google Switch Transformer (2021).

DeepSeek’s MoE scaling strategy.

Practice

Train/fine-tune with LoRA + Quantization.

Experiment with MoE routing in smaller models.

🔹 After 4 Months → You’ll Be Able To:

✅ Explain & implement PPO, GRPO, and DPO.
✅ Train/fine-tune LLMs with RLHF using HuggingFace TRL & Unsloth.
✅ Use quantization & LoRA to run models on smaller hardware.
✅ Read cutting-edge research (like DeepSeek Zero, MoE, RLVR) without confusion.

⚡ To make it really practical, I can prepare a starter project plan for you (e.g., “train a small GRPO agent on arithmetic reasoning with Unsloth”). That way, you’ll have a concrete milestone at the end.

👉 Do you want me to prepare such a hands-on mini-project outline for Month 3–4, so you can actually build and test PPO vs GRPO on a small LLM?
