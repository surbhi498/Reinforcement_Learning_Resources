Learning Roadmap for LLM Training + GRPO

This roadmap takes you from transformer foundations → reinforcement learning → RLHF (PPO/GRPO) → efficient LLM training in just 4 months.

📅 Month 1 → Foundations (Transformers + Deep Learning)

🎯 Goal: Build strong foundations in deep learning & transformers.

📚 Courses & Books

Deep Learning Specialization – Andrew Ng (Coursera)
 → solid ML/DL grounding.

Dive into Deep Learning (d2l.ai, free)
 → hands-on PyTorch coding.

The Illustrated Transformer
 → intuitive understanding of attention.

🛠️ Practice

Train a small character-level GPT in PyTorch.

Implement attention from scratch.

📅 Month 2 → Reinforcement Learning Basics (for PPO/GRPO)

🎯 Goal: Understand RL concepts deeply enough to follow PPO.

📚 Courses

David Silver’s RL Lectures (DeepMind, YouTube)
 → conceptual backbone.

Spinning Up in Deep RL (OpenAI)
 → hands-on PPO implementation.

🛠️ Practice

Implement PPO on a toy problem (CartPole in Gymnasium).

Learn policy gradient, value function, advantage estimation (needed for PPO → GRPO).

📅 Month 3 → RLHF for LLMs (PPO → GRPO)

🎯 Goal: Transition from generic RL → RLHF for LLMs.

📄 Core Papers

OpenAI (2017): Fine-Tuning LMs from Human Preferences

Anthropic (2022): Constitutional AI

DeepSeek (2024): GRPO Algorithm

🛠️ Tutorials & Tools

HuggingFace TRL
 → PPO training with LLMs.

Unsloth
 → GRPO implementation with efficient training.

Explore DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) as a lighter alternative to PPO.

🧪 Practice

Run PPO fine-tuning on LLaMA-7B / Mistral-7B with HuggingFace TRL.

Switch to GRPO with Unsloth and compare PPO vs GRPO training.

📅 Month 4 → Efficiency (Quantization + MoE + Scaling Tricks)

🎯 Goal: Learn how big labs make LLMs efficient.

⚡ Quantization

Papers: LLM.int8(), SmoothQuant.

Try 4-bit & 8-bit quantization with Unsloth/QLoRA.

⚡ Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Google Switch Transformer (2021).

DeepSeek’s MoE scaling strategy.

🛠️ Practice

Fine-tune with LoRA + Quantization.

Experiment with MoE routing in smaller models.

✅ After 4 Months You’ll Be Able To:

Explain & implement PPO, GRPO, and DPO.

Train/fine-tune LLMs with RLHF using HuggingFace TRL & Unsloth.

Use quantization & LoRA to run models on smaller hardware.

Read and understand cutting-edge research like DeepSeek Zero, MoE, RLVR.

⚡ Next Step → Hands-On Mini Project

💡 Example: Train a small GRPO agent on arithmetic reasoning with Unsloth, and compare its performance to PPO.
This will serve as your final milestone project at the end of Month 4.
